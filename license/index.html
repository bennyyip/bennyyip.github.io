</span><span style="color:#323232;">Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
</span><span style="color:#323232;">original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
</span><span style="color:#323232;">and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
</span><span style="color:#323232;">following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
</span><span style="color:#323232;">exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     the licensor&#39;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 2 -- Scope.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  a. License grant.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               in part; and

</span><span style="color:#323232;">

</span><span style="color:#323232;">          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public

</span><span style="color:#323232;">          its terms and conditions.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          6(a).
</span><span style="color:#323232;">

</span><span style="color:#323232;">          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

</span><span style="color:#323232;">       5. Downstream recipients.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">

</span><span style="color:#323232;">               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#323232;">               Material.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. Other rights.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          Rights, but not otherwise.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 3 -- License Conditions.

</span><span style="color:#323232;">          information.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          reasonably practicable.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">

</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
</span><span style="color:#323232;">apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
</span><span style="color:#323232;">

</span><span style="color:#323232;">     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     portion of the contents of the database;
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

</span><span style="color:#323232;">  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share

</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR

</span><span style="color:#323232;">     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     waiver of all liability.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     terminate automatically.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">          violation; or
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     of this Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     will not terminate this Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">Section 8 -- Interpretation.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     be made without permission under this Public License.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     conditions.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     Licensor.
</span><span style="color:#323232;">
</span><span style="color:#323232;">  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
</span><span style="color:#323232;">     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
